# Course-Project-2

The overall goal of this assignment is to explore the National Emissions Inventory database and see what it say about fine particulate matter pollution in the United states over the 10-year period 1999â€“2008. You may use any R package you want to support your analysis.

# Making and Submitting Plots

For each plot you should

1. Construct the plot and save it to a PNG file.
2. Create a separate R code file (plot1.R, plot2.R, etc.) that constructs the corresponding plot, i.e. code in plot1.R constructs the plot1.png plot. Your code file should include code for reading the data so that the plot can be fully reproduced. You should also include the code that creates the PNG file. Only include the code for a single plot (i.e. plot1.R should only include code for producing plot1.png)
3. Upload the PNG file on the Assignment submission page
4. Copy and paste the R code from the corresponding R file into the text box at the appropriate point in the peer assessment.
